# animal-recognition
Recognizes animals. A way for me to practice fundmental neural network concepts.

The training data is  from [Animal-10](https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99/animals10), an image collection of 10 different animals: dogs, cats, horses, spiders, butterflies, chicens, cows, squirrels, and elephants. I used the [translated version](https://www.kaggle.com/viratkothari/animal10).
