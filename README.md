# animal-recognition
Deep learning networks for image recognition of animals. Two networks are planned, a CNN and a GNN.  This serves as practice for building/training deep neural networks and my attempt at applying GNNs to image recognition. WIP



The training data is  from [Animal-10](https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99/animals10), an image collection of 10 different animals: dogs, cats, horses, spiders, butterflies, chicens, cows, squirrels, and elephants. I used the [translated version](https://www.kaggle.com/viratkothari/animal10).
